    <p>La Bandera Dominicana is the tricolor Dominican flag with its distinctive red and blue opposing quarters, divided by a white cross.</p>
    <p>Its namesake, La Bandera Dominicana food, is the Dominican national lunch meal. The red is represented by the beans, the white by the rice, and – with a splash of poetic and culinary license here – the meat – usually chicken or beef – represents the third color.</p>
