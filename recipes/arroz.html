  <h1>White Rice</h1>

  <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>4 cups long grain rice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Heating the water:</strong> In a medium aluminum pot (Amazon affiliate link) (minimum 2.5 liters [0.5 gal] capacity) heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat, add the salt. When the oil is a little hot add 6 cups [1.4 liters] of water, taking care not to splash.</p>
      <p>If you use another type of pot, just combine oil, salt, and water and heat over medium heat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Adding the rice:</strong> When the water reaches boiling point, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Covering the rice:</strong> When the water has evaporated, cover with the lid and cook over very low heat (but enough to generate steam) for 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Remove the lid, stir, add the remaining oil and cover again. This oil will help the rice to shine, and the concón will be crispier.</p>
      <p>In 5 more minutes taste the rice, it should be firm but soft inside. If necessary cover again and leave for another 5 minutes on low heat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Serving:</strong> As soon as the rice is ready, remove it from the pot and place it in a serving dish (this prevents the concón from getting soggy). Scrape off the concón (rice stuck to the bottom) and serve on the side.</p>
      <p> with meat, fish or seafood, salad, and beans.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
