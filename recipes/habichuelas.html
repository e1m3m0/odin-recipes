  <h1>Stewed Beans</h1>

  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups dry pinto beans, (or cranberry, or red kidney)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>half teaspoon oregano (dry, ground)</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 small red onion, cut into four quarters</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 cup diced kabocha squash</li>
    <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>leaves from a celery stalk</li>
    <li>4 spring fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon of dry thyme</li>
    <li>half teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the beans overnight.</li>
    <li>Remove the beans from the soaking water and boil in fresh water until they are soft (may take up to an hour, or about 20 minutes in a pressure cooker).</li>
    <li>Separate the beans from the boiling water. Set both aside.</li>  
    <li>In a pot heat the oil over medium heat. Add oregano, bell pepper, onion, garlic, auyama, tomato sauce, celery, thyme and cilantro. Cook and stir for half a minute. Add the beans and simmer for two minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in 4 cups of the water in which the beans boiled (complete with fresh water if necessary). Once it reaches a rolling boil, lightly mashed the beans with a potato masher to break them out of the skin and making creamier habichuelas. Cook until it reaches a creamy consistency.</li>
    <li>Remove the chunks of onion, as well as any stray twigs or large bits of herbs if you used fresh herbs. Season with salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve with the other components of La Bandera Dominicana.</li>
